RafaÅ‚:
	Making game playable for two

Bartek:
	Find models of:
		players,
		bombs,
		destructable fields,
	Textures:
		walls,
		floor,
		light (optional - can be a wireframed geometry or invisible)
	Add models to:
		- players
		- bombs
		- obstacles

-------------- THOUGHTS------------------
1) Game creation has to be based on classes
	- easier player moving
		class objects manipulation (not a string) -- Preparation done

2) Player moves are registered every time they step on a new field
	- find out if field index changes 
		as player crosses the GridHelper's field line
	- player can move freely, smoothly, he doesn't tp between positions
	- animation of moving player played after receiving info from server, 
		that oppiste player moved (same with bombs)

2b) Players phisically added after they've logged in
	- returning player string from the server
	  ^	  based on that string we generate a player in threejs (starting position)
	  |
	already done

2c) #optional - We can add player info -> some rectangle in the corner of a screen
		showing player details 
		(mainly name + optionally logout button #uselessExtas)

3) ajaxes sent every time player moves to the next field
	position updated on server


4) window with loading circle when u join and u alone (pepposad) before ur enemy join tho
	sending info to player that someone join
