------------ WORK DIVISION --------------
Rafa≈Ç:
	Making game playable for two

Bartek:
	Find models of:
		players,
		bombs,
		destructable fields,
	Textures:
		walls,
		floor,
		light (optional - can be a wireframed geometry or invisible)


-------------- THOUGHTS------------------
1) Game creation has to be based on classes
	easier player moving
		class objects manipulation (not a string)

2) Player moves are registered every time they step on a new field
	find out if field index changes 
		as player crosses the GridHelper's field line
	player can move freely, smoothly, he doesn't tp between positions
	animation of moving player played after receiving info from server
